    "Description":"In the year 2000 several populations of invasive marine algae, <i>Caulerpa taxifolia</i>, were found in Southern California, specifically in Huntington Beach and Carlsbad. In Europe and Australia, releases of this species resulted in extensive populations destroying native communities and reducing biodiversity in both native aquatic vegetation and animal communities relying on the vegetation. This project led to the successful removal of the invasive seaweed species, protecting native biodiversity and functioning ecosystems. Surveys conducted verified that the removal of the species was complete.",

In the early 19th century, San Diego’s importance as a naval and shipping port grew, and the Army Corps of Engineers dredged out what is now Mission Bay in order to save the larger San Diego Bay from sedimentation. Mission Bay has been a recreational area since its creation, and has routine dredging to maintain the bay. This project attempts to mitigate negative impacts from the routine dredging by replanting eelgrass in areas where dredging has damaged the bay ecosystem. This project includes both mapping of the extent of seagrass within Mission Bay as well as the replanting of the seagrass.",

    "Description":"For the last 100 years, kelp forests off the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, California have been shrinking. Urban runoff, development, and sedimentation limits kelp growth, while overfishing reduces competition and predation of purple urchins. Purple urchins consume the kelp holdfasts at the ocean floor and create urchin barrens, destroying kelp forest and related communities that live in the kelp forests. This restoration project aims to reduce purple urchin density in the benthic environment, allowing kelp forests to regrow and support fish and invertebrate communities. Currently, 46 acres of kelp forest have been restored using this method. The project has observed increasing biodiversity and biomass in kelp, invertebrate, and fish populations, as well as increases in the availability of recreational fishing targets and increased red urchin yield to fisheries.",

This is due to a combination of factors, including an extreme marine heatwave, population increases in purple sea urchins, lack of nutrients, and a wasting disease affecting local sea stars. The Greater Farallones Marine Sanctuary, found in this area, sponsored the creation of a Kelp Recovery Working Group, working with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to develop strategies and guidelines for kelp recovery in the region. The researchers estimate that up to $44 million in fishery recreational value would be restored through kelp restoration. The group stresses the importance of reducing grazing pressure from purple sea urchins and enhancing kelp populations in order to in the short term help the kelp populations.",

    "Description":"The Atlantic side of Virginia’s Eastern Shore became a hotbed for recreational tourism in the form of hunting and fishing in the 19th century, only to see its seafood and bird harvesting yields drop precipitously by the Great Depression, mainly due to overharvesting, disease, storms, and loss of habitat. By the end of the 20th century the communities of sea grasses, shellfish like oysters and scallops, other fish, and birds had not naturally restored, making it a focal project for the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program. This program aims to restore seagrass populations through transplanting seeds from healthy populations in a process called “seed broadcasting”. By 2013, over five thousand acres of seagrass beds were restored.",

    "Description":"The Strait of Georgia, adjacent to Puget Sound, has many of the same environmental factors affecting seagrass. Population growth in the region and land use changes along the shorelines have contributed to environmental degradation and losses of seagrass populations. The Drayton Harbor Eelgrass Restoration Project involved planting seagrass to help mitigate the impacts of development projects in the Pacific Northwest. The researchers manipulated the site elevation through filling and planting seagrass on top of the filling.",

Monitoring in 2018 showed that the northwestern part of the site had no eelgrass, while the southeastern part had eelgrass shoots present.",

    "Description":"Kelp forests in Puget Sound, found with rocky shallow substrates, have been disappearing over the course of the twentieth century, much like other marine vegetation in the area. Increased coastal development and decreasing water quality contribute to this decline in marine vegetation populations. The scientists in this restoration effort in Port Gamble Bay used a variety of replanting techniques to encourage kelp regrowth. They used ropes seeded with microscopic juvenile kelp, planting of kelp reproductive parts in new areas, and collecting mature kelp blades and anchoring them in the new restoration area.",
