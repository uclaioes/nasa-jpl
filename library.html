           The persistence of Antibiotic-Resistant Genes (ARGs) as they relate to Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (ARBs)
            in the environment is not only misunderstood but very difficult to trace within the environment because of 
            lack of standardization in detection techniques and difficulty quantifying the amount of exposure to ARGs 
            that cause harm tohuman health. The major sources of ARB are a result of overprescription of antibiotics, 
            the use of antimicrobial products in hospitals, and the mass use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in livestock management. 
            The key focus of our research will be understanding how the use of
            broad-spectrum antibiotics used to both promote growth and prevent disease in livestock creates an issue of
            ARG persistence in the environment. The effects of the use of antibiotics in agriculture and overprescription has 
            led to 700,000 deaths annually and creates a major global health crisis without much knowledge by the public (Li 1). 
            Being able to identify the locations of these major point sources of ARG and ARB proliferation in agriculture 
            will help us understand how they can persist in runoff and eventually help eliminate the concentration of ARGs in our coastal ecosystems.

              <div class="collapse" id="czma">
                <p>
                Antibiotics encompass a wide range of chemical compounds that can be produced naturally, semi-synthetically, 
                  and synthetically (Manyi-Loh et al., 2018). In humans and animals, antibiotics are used to fight bacterial 
                  infections by either killing bacteria or stopping bacterial growth (CDC, 2020). However, like us, bacteria 
                  are constantly evolving and passing on new genetic material that makes them increasingly resistant to the 
                  antibiotics designed to inhibit them. In 1942, the first antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), Staphylococcus aureus, 
                  was discovered, and the race between effective antibiotics and bacterial resistance has not stopped since (CDC, 2020).
                  The creation of and selection for ARB is caused by the consistent, frequent,
                  and, in some cases, improper use of antibiotics (Le et al., 2018). Every time an antibiotic is used, there is an 
                  opportunity for bacteria to become resistant (Wu et al., 2019). When there is exposure to an antibiotic, microbial 
                  communities share resistant genes across genera to positively select for new resistant strains, even at heightened 
                  metabolic cost (Griffin et al., 2020). Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics by either intracellular 
                  mutation or by acquiring mobilized antibiotic-resistant genes (ARG) from other bacteria (Wu et al., 2019). 
                  ARGs are found in plasmids, which serve as mobile carriers for genetic information. Horizontal transfer of 
                  plasmids allows bacteria to adapt to antibiotics and acquire these ARGs at an alarmingly quick rate in the human body 
                  (Stalder et al., 2019). This process can alter the human microbiome and cause health disturbances. The human microbiome 
                  is a complex ecosystem consisting of bacteria, viruses, archaea, or eukaryotes that co-evolve together from various 
                  selective pressures like antibiotics, diet, and lifestyle (Baron et al., 2018). Bacteria naturally compete against 
                  each other and acquire ARGs as a survival mechanism (Rolain et al., 2016).

                  How do Antibiotics Enter the Environment?
                  <div>
                  
                <p>
                  Antibiotics can enter the environment from a variety of places including industries, people, and farming.
The manufacturing of antibiotics creates wastewater from the factories which is discharged into the environment via streams, 
                  lagoons, and holding ponds. Even if this water is treated to try to remove the pollutants, the concentration of 
                  antibiotics can be magnitudes higher than in waters where accidental exposure occurs (Larsson, 2014). 
                  This is because wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat specialized micropollutants such as antibiotics 
                  (Pruden, 2006). As a result, both discharge locations from antibiotic manufacturing as well as wastewater treatment 
                  plants are locations where antibiotics may enter the environment.
People are also a source of antibiotics entering the environment. An increasing number of people are demanding antibiotic treatments for 
                  illnesses, even if a bacterial infection is not the cause of infection. Each year, 30% of outpatient, oral antibiotic 
                  prescriptions in the U.S, totaling 34 million prescriptions, are written unnecessarily (Fleming-Dutra, 2016). A common
                  issue is when people do not complete the full course of their antibiotics treatments and dispose of the antibiotics improperly 
                  (Larsson, 2014). Additionally, up to 95% of antibiotics can be excreted from humans in an unaltered state (Pruden, 2006). 
                  Combined with wastewater treatment plants’ limited abilities to filter out antibiotics, this means an increasing number of 
                  antibiotics are being released into the environment unaltered, allowing for bacteria to develop resistance to them.
Over 20.5 million lbs of antibiotics were sold in the U.S in 2018, and 65% were used for animal farming (Wallinga, 2020). Similarly to people, 
                  95% of antibiotics can be excreted from animals in an unaltered state (Pruden, 2006). This means that manures from animal 
                  farming can carry high levels of antibiotics if the animals had received antibiotics. When manures are used for crop farming, 
                  these antibiotics are transferred to the crops. This means antibiotics are being transferred from animals to crops and from 
                  crops to people via the food system (Finley, 2013).Along each stage, bacteria are exposed to antibiotics and able to build resistance.
Once in the environment, antibiotics, like many other pollutants, can move. For example, discharge sites have been shown to contaminate groundwater
                  in some cases, leading to contamination in drinking water as well (Larsson, 2014). Tracking the movement of antibiotics in 
                  the environment can give insight into where ARB may be located.

ARB populations develop via the natural selection process described above. Therefore, when a group of bacteria is exposed to antibiotics, a population of ARB may be established in that area of exposure. This is especially true for prolonged antibiotic exposure. Unlike other pollutants, ARB are often enriched after treatment because the treatment will only kill the bacteria without resistance, leaving the “strongest” bacteria to survive and reproduce (Pruden, 2006).
Tracking antibiotic movement in the environment, several potential ‘hot spots’ for the enrichment and transmission of resistant bacteria” can be identified (Finley, 2013, p. 705). These locations would be ones in which bacteria can spread, and are exposed to antibiotics to build resistance. It includes locations talked about above such as industrial discharge sites, farms, and communities (European Union, 2014).
                    </p>
                      <p>
                      While ARB are an important piece of the puzzle, the real interest for human health is the pathway of ARGs through the environment. This is because while ARGs often follow the pathway of ARB and the pathway of antibiotics in the environment, they often persist longer in the pathway (Pruden, 2006). ARGs can move through the environment in 3 ways: vertical gene transfer, horizontal gene transfer, and dissemination.
Vertical gene transfer refers to the spread of genes from parent to offspring. Bacteria often reproduce by a parent bacteria duplicating itself. Therefore, if the parent cell has ARGs, the daughter cell does too.
Horizontal gene transfer is how bacteria cells share DNA with other bacteria cells. There are three types of horizontal gene transfer: conjugation, transduction, and transformation.
Conjugation refers to the process of a donor bacteria cell forming a bridge with a receiver bacteria cell. DNA can then be transferred through the bridge from the donor to the receiver bacteria (Burmeister, 2015). If the DNA transferred contained ARGs, the receiver cell can reproduce the ARGs.
Transduction refers to the process of a phage (virus) infecting a bacteria cell (Burmeister, 2015). Phages will insert their DNA into a bacteria cell, using the bacterial organs to make copies of the viral DNA. Once copies of the viral DNA have been made, they are packaged into other viruses. However, sometimes host bacteria DNA is packaged with viral DNA. Therefore, when the viruses are released from the bacteria host to infect other bacteria, the host bacteria DNA is also spread. If the host bacteria contained ARGs, these ARGs can be spread through viral infections.
Transformation refers to the uptake of DNA from the environment (Burmeister, 2015). This process is especially important in tracking antibiotic resistance because “even if cells carrying ARGs have been killed, DNA released to the environment has been observed to persist” (Pruden, 2006, p.7445). Researchers have found an increasing number of ARGs in soils since the 1940s, which protected them from being broken down (Wright, 2010). This is important because even if a population of ARB is eliminated, the resistant gene could surface again at a later time, although unlikely to be in a pathogen (Palme, 2018). It also means hydrology serves as a major pathway forARG transfer.
Dissemination refers to the spread of ARGs, often through the spread of ARB. ARB hitchhike “ from humans to animals, and vice versa, often through various environmental pathways, including foodstuffs, animal wastes, and water sources” (Finley, 2013, p.708). As the bacteria move around, so do the genes they carry. Therefore, stopping the spread of ARB is an important step in slowing the spread of ARGs. However, even after the bacteria dies,their DNA and the ARGs they carry can persist through horizontal gene transfer. ARGs in water treatment plant filters have led to ARGs in drinking water through dissemination (Larsson, 2014).

                  Antibiotics encompass a wide range of chemical compounds that can be produced naturally, semi-synthetically, and synthetically (Manyi-Loh et al., 2018). They are used to stop bacterial growth (“bacteriostatic”) or kill bacterial growth (“bactericidal”) with minimal damage to the host receiving them (Milic et al., 2013; Martínez, 2012; Gillings, 2013). They are categorized as either bacteriostatic or bactericidal, as well as by their scope in the pathogens they target as either narrow or broad-spectrum. These drugs are not only used in clinical settings, but they are also regularly used in livestock farming to treat and prevent animal diseases, promote growth, and improve feed-to-weight ratios (You & Silbergeld, 2014; Hong et al., 2013; Hao et al., 2014). Increasing consumer demand for animal protein worldwide is instigating more intensive farming methods (Manyi-Log et al., 2018). Antibiotics given to livestock is resulting in consequent antibiotic residues in animal-derived products and waste streams. 
Globally, the main classes of antibiotics widely used in agriculture include tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, β-lactams, lincosamides, macrolides, pleuromutilins, and sulphonamides (Finley et al., 2013; De Briyne et al., 2014; Baynes et al., 2016). The overall quantity of antibiotics used in agriculture is estimated to fall between 63,000 and 240,000 tons. In fact, about 80% of antibiotics sold in the U.S. are used for animal production alone (Ventola, 2015). Contrastingly, Sweden is an example of a country that has banned antibiotics for animal growth purposes. According to Swedish agricultural data, there were no recorded loss of production after they implemented this ban (Cogliani et al, 2011). This example shows that such policies have the potential to be effective since reduction of antibiotic use was not followed by pervasive animal disease and successfully reduced antibiotic resistance buildup (Wierup, 2001).

          <h2 id="librarySection3" class="pt-3">Fecal indicator bacteria and ESBL - E. coli</h2>
          <p class="pt-2">
        When conducting surveillance of antibiotic resistance in the environment, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are often focused on because of their pathogenic potential and ability to acquire resistance easily (Reinthaler et al.,  2003; Collignon, 2009). FIB are bacteria that live in the gut of warm-blooded animals and are introduced into the environment through fecal matter (NOAA GLERL, n.d.). While FIB are generally harmless, they indicate the possible presence of other pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protozoans found in fecal matter (US EPA, n.d.c). Since testing for the presence of many different pathogens is expensive and difficult, water systems are typically tested for a few subgroups of bacteria instead. The most commonly tested FIB include total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli (E. coli), fecal streptococci, and enterococci. 
Total coliforms are a widespread group of bacteria that can occur in human feces, but also other places outside the human body. For drinking water, total coliforms are still a standard indicator test because their presence indicates contamination of a water supply by an outside source. Fecal coliforms are a subset of total coliform bacteria, which are more fecal-specific in origin. For recreational waters, this group was used as the primary bacteria indicator until relatively recently when the EPA began recommending E. coli and enterococci as better indicators of health risk from a water system. E. coli is a species of fecal coliform bacteria that is considered the best indicator bacteria to use for recreational water quality monitoring because of its specificity, ease of detection, and how well studied it has been historically (McLain et al., 2016; Wuijts et al., 2017; Vikesland et al., 2017). In the past, ratios of fecal streptococci to fecal coliforms were monitored to determine whether contamination was of human or nonhuman origin. This is no longer recommended as a reliable bacterial source tracking test. Lastly, enterococci are a subgroup of fecal streptococci and are distinguished by their ability to survive in salt water conditions. Because of this, the EPA now recommends enterococci be the indicator of health risk in salt water used for recreation.  
Since these groups of bacteria commonly reside in the intestines of warm-blooded animals, they are subjected to frequent exposure to antibiotics consumed by their host which creates high selection pressure (Khadori, 2012). As an example, E. coli can be used to measure antibiotic resistance by looking at extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli). ESBLs are plasmid-mediated enzymes produced by E. coli that inhibit β-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems) (Fuentes et al., 2019; Shanthi & Sekar, 2010). These enzymes also show co-resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. Infections caused by ESBLs can range from UTIs to life-threatening sepsis (Rawat & Nair, 2010). Antibiotic-resistant infections result in longer hospitalization times and require intake of stronger and more expensive medicines, resulting in higher medical costs and patient complications. With the spread of antibiotic resistance accelerating across the globe, monitoring bacteria like ESBL-E. coli is critical.

                    Carlos Duarte and his fellow researchers uncover an
                    astonishing link between seagrass detritus and continental
                    shelf/deep sea food webs. Moreover, by tracking the export
                    of carbon outside of seagrass meadows,
                    this paper highlights a forgotten portion of carbon
                    sequestration provided by seagrasses. This finding helps
                    the reader further understand the importance of marine
                    ecosystem
                    services and provides support for the need of
                    restoration projects and the scope of their impacts.

                    It is increasingly important to know just how much carbon
                    can be sequestered by nearshore habitats and marine
                    vegetation. In this paper, Carlos Duarte shows us the
                    astonishing level of importance these habitats have in the
                    global carbon cycle. The paper finds that these habitats
                    could potentially sequester anywhere from 3%-33% of all
                    oceanic carbon.

                    Blue carbon sequestration by seagrass has long been a
                    topic of debate and research. However, the same cannot be
                    said for kelp forests. Kelp forests are some of the most
                    productive environments on the globe; Dorte Krause-Jensen
                    and his colleagues took a deeper look into their carbon
                    sequestration potential. What they found was astonishing,
                    as kelp could potentially sequester more carbon than all
                    other marine blue carbon habitats combined.

                    and his fellow researchers in an attempt to fully
                    categorize the monetary value of seagrasses. They state
                    that this has been a particularly difficult job
                    in the past due to the multitude of ecosystem services and
                    inherent interconnectivity of marine systems. Thus, they
                    focus their efforts on the value of fish biomass that
                    inhabits the ecosystem, proving fruitful
                    with a value of $655,953.63 USD per hectare. They also go
                    further in estimating the value of fish who migrate out of
                    these meadows, using them as nurseries early in their life

                    Maria Potouroglou and fellow researchers attempt to fill
                    an important knowledge gap in seagrass ecosystem services.
                    While much is known about sediment accretion variations
                    within mangrove and salt marsh
                    habitats over long periods of time, the same can not be
                    said for seagrass. That is, until this study found a stark
                    difference between the variability in elevation of the
                    benthic environment when comparing
                    vegetated and unvegetated areas.

                    Nicole Price and her associates take an in-depth look at
                    the interplay between ecosystem services provided by Sugar
                    Kelp, the health of mussels, and ocean acidification. As
                    of April 2020, the full paper has not
                    yet been published, but the abstract and preliminary
                    findings paint a clear picture. The cultivation of kelp
                    and shellfish in congruence can greatly improve both the
                    overall health and shell thickness of
                    mussels, while the kelp ecosystems provide a variable
                    “halo effect” that can be quantitatively measured.

                    Sarah Traiger and her associates study the variance of
                    biochemical profiles in giant kelp forests. What they find
                    is that the variability is more pronounced in the surface
                    waters and is highly dependent on the
                    time of day. Finally, this paper determines that kelp
                    forests may have diel influence on pH and dissolved oxygen
                    content due to their
                    large productive canopy. However, the paper has yet to be
                    published in its entirety and the above
                    conclusions were made from the abstract only.
