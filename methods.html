                    During satellite overpass days, water samples were collected between the time window of 10:15 AM - 1:15 PM. Six liters of water were collected from each beach site at the coordinates listed below. Sample bottles were labeled with the date and location, kept on ice, and transported back to the lab within three hours. Generic temperature and pH probes, as well as a turbidity meter, were used to record values on-site at the time of collection. Turbidity measurements taken on-site were assumed to be the “true” turbidity values and are hereafter referred to as “on-site probe turbidity”.

                    A Hydrolab Multiparameter Sonde was used to measure pH, turbidity, conductivity, and % dissolved oxygen for each sample in lab. Turbidity and pH were measured using more than 1 device in our project in order to gather more comprehensive data

                 The Thermo Scientific Orion AQUAfast AQ3010 Turbidity Meter was taken to each sampling site to obtain turbidity values in the field. Turbidity values were reported by the meter in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). A clean, dry sample vial was handled by the top cap and rinsed with 10 mL of sample water three times. On the fourth fill, the vial was capped with 10 mL of sample water and wiped dry with a soft, lint-free cloth. A thin film of silicone oil was then applied and wiped around the vial. The vial was then inserted into the sample well of the meter for measurement by aligning the arrow on the meter with the arrow on the outside of the vial. The meter was then turned on, the “Read/Enter” button was pushed, and the measured value appeared several seconds later.

                    Three 1.5 µm filters were used to measure TSS for each site. Before use, filters were washed, baked for sterilization, and stored in a desiccator until needed. Initial weights of each filter were recorded immediately before running sample water through them. Then, a funnel manifold was set up with suction and filters were sealed on with deionized water. Between 100 mL-600 mL of sample water was passed through each filter (final calculations of weight accounted for the volume used). The filters were removed with tweezers, placed on individual aluminum pans, and dried for 24 hours in an oven. Lastly, filters were cooled in a desiccator and final weights were recorded.

                    To assess light absorbance, A spectrometer paired with the UV Express software were used to obtain light absorbance data. A baseline reading was established by adding 1 mL of MilliQ water to a glass cuvette in the spectrometer. After getting the baseline, a sampling cuvette was prepared and filled with 1 mL of sample water. Each sample was run from a frequency of 1100 nm to 190 nm, and the sample cuvette was rinsed 3 times with MilliQ water between each sample. After testing all of the samples, the data was exported from the software and saved.

                    	Prepared sample tubes with the PhosVer 3 Phosphate reagent were labeled for each sample site. The “Phosphorus, Reactive (Orthophosphate)” test was used on the LAMBDA 365 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer with a light shield in cell compartment 2. 5.0 mL of sample water was added to the appropriate Test ‘N Tube Vial, capped, and mixed. The vial was wiped down to remove fingerprints and inserted into the 16 mm round cell holder to zero the spectrophotometer. One PhosVer 3 Phosphate Powder Pillow was added to the sample, capped, and shaken for 20 seconds. After two minutes, the tube was placed inside the spectrophotometer. The detectable range of PO43- for this test is from 0.06 to 5.00 mg/L PO43-.

                    All square sample cells were cleaned with detergent and rinsed with deionized water before use. The “351 N, Nitrate LR” test was selected on the LAMBDA 365 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer. A 25 mL graduated mixing cylinder was filled with 15 mL of sample water, and one NitraVer 6 Reagent Powder Pillow was added. The cylinder was closed, vigorously shaken for 3 minutes, and then left to rest for 2 minutes. Once the timer sounded, 10 mL of the solution was added to a clean square sample cell. One NitriVer 3 Reagent Powder Pillow was then added to this cell and gently shaken for 30 seconds. The sample cell was then left to rest for a reaction period of 15 minutes during which time a pink color appeared if nitrate was present in the sample. While the 15 minute reaction period elapsed, a new square sample cell was filled with 10 mL of the sample water and ran to zero the spectrophotometer. After 15 minutes, the prepared sample was run through the spectrophotometer. The detectable range of NO3-- N for this test is from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/L NO3--N.

               All square sample cells were cleaned with detergent and rinsed with deionized water before use. The “385 N, Ammonia, Salic.” test was selected on the LAMBDA 365 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer. One square sample cell was filled with 10 mL of the sample while another was filled with 10 mL of deionized water. The contents of one Ammonia Salicylate powder pillow was added to each square sample cell. The square sample cells were then shaken enough to dissolve the reagent and left to rest for 3 minutes. Once the 3 minutes elapsed, one Ammonia Cyanurate powder pillow was added to each sample cell, shaken until the reagent was dissolved, and then left to rest for 15 minutes. If ammonia was present, a green color would develop as the reaction occurred. Once 15 minutes had elapsed, the blank sample cell with the deionized water was wiped clean, inserted into the cell holder of the spectrophotometer, and zeroed. The square sample cell was then wiped, inserted, and read to show results in mg/L of NH3–N. The detectable range of NH3–N for this test was from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/L NH3–N.

                    Pollution from human activity can
                    create hostile environments for
                    seagrass and kelp growth. Nutrient
                    loading can spark eutrophication, an
                    overgrowth of algae that blocks out
                    needed light from reaching
                    vegetation on the seafloor.
                    Industrial wastewater can also lower
                    the water quality enough to degrade
                    the aquatic ecosystems. The
                    elimination or reduction of this
                    pollution can allow the area to be
                    recolonized.

                    Mechanical disturbance was

                    A technique that is not always
                    necessary is the utilization of test
                    plots. These allow restoration
                    techniques to be evaluated for
                    success on a small scale before
                    translating the technique to the
                    entire restoration site. While this
                    allows maximum efficacy to be
                    evaluated, it does tend to require a
                    trial period, delaying the
                    restoration of the site.

                    When manually re-establishing
                    seagrass beds, seagrass “donor
                    sites” are utilized. Seed collection
                    from several donor sites can provide
                    genetic diversity for the budding
                    colony. The reproductive shoots,
                    which contain the seeds, are removed
                    from the donor site and are usually
                    transported to an aquaculture
                    facility, where the seeds mature
                    before being planted at the
                    recipient sites.

                    Reproductive shoots were initially
                    harvested by a team of divers. This
                    proved slow and cost-ineffective. A
                    water chestnut harvesting boat was
                    repurposed for cutting and
                    collecting reproductive shoots,
                    which stood taller than the general
                    vegetation and could therefore be
                    harvested without damaging the
                    ecosystem. Seeds were broadcasted by
                    placing the shoots in mesh bags
                    above the sediment, allowing the
                    seeds to drop out when mature.
                    Manual broadcasting was also used to
                    evenly allocate the seeds.
