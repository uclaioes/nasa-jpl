      <h1>Nasa JPL Practicum Team</h1>
      <div class="p-4 card bordered">
        <p>In recent years, there has been a rise in the
          prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs)
          that is jeopardizing our ability to treat infections
          and diseases (Meek, et al. 2015). We need to
          understand how ARBs are transported through the
          environment in order to research the effects they
          have on the human body. During storm events, ARBs
          that accumulate on land enter coastal waters through
          runoff pathways and can be ingested or inhaled by
          people during recreational ocean activities. An
          example of an antibiotic resistant bacteria is
          methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
          which causes skin infections and can be
          life-threatening. A prior practicum team found that
          people who surfed during and soon after wet weather
          events were over six times more likely to carry MRSA
          in their nasal cavities than surfers who avoided the
          water during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our practicum team will use findings from the
          previous project and couple it with new remote
          sensing satellite data to expand future water
          quality analysis. Currently, easy and immediate
          access to information on water quality is
          unavailable. Field sampling provides accurate water
          quality data, but it can be costly and is
          infrequently collected. A cheaper, more accessible
          option for analyzing water quality is remote
          sensing, which involves collecting imagery of large
          spatial areas from NASA’s satellites. The
          relationship between harmful contaminant plumes and
          satellite data will be investigated by
          simultaneously collecting water samples as
          satellites pass over the Southern California coast.
          This project aims to advance the application of
          satellite data modeling for public health, and has
          the potential to better inform the public about how
          they can protect themselves from harmful pathogens
          in coastal waters.
