                            In recent years, there has been a rise in the
                            prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs)
                            that is jeopardizing our ability to treat infections
                            and diseases (Meek, et al. 2015). We need to
                            understand how ARBs are transported through the
                            environment in order to research the effects they
                            have on the human body. During storm events, ARBs
                            that accumulate on land enter coastal waters through
                            runoff pathways and can be ingested or inhaled by
                            people during recreational ocean activities. An
                            example of an antibiotic resistant bacteria is
                            methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
                            which causes skin infections and can be
                            life-threatening. A prior practicum team found that
                            people who surfed during and soon after wet weather
                            events were over six times more likely to carry MRSA
                            in their nasal cavities than surfers who avoided the
                            water during this time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our practicum team will use findings from the
                            previous project and couple it with new remote
                            sensing satellite data to expand future water
                            quality analysis. Currently, easy and immediate
                            access to information on water quality is
                            unavailable. Field sampling provides accurate water
                            quality data, but it can be costly and is
                            infrequently collected. A cheaper, more accessible
                            option for analyzing water quality is remote
                            sensing, which involves collecting imagery of large
                            spatial areas from NASA’s satellites. The
                            relationship between harmful contaminant plumes and
                            satellite data will be investigated by
                            simultaneously collecting water samples as
                            satellites pass over the Southern California coast.
                            This project aims to advance the application of
                            satellite data modeling for public health, and has
                            the potential to better inform the public about how
                            they can protect themselves from harmful pathogens
                            in coastal waters.
